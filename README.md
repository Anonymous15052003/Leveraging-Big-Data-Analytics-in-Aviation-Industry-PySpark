## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm Ashutosh pursuing Masters in applied machine intelligence and as part of my Big Data course, I have utlized the big data analytics tool and performed an analysis on the metadata of the airline flights that occurred in the United States between the years 1987 and 2008. To begin, it is necessary for us to investigate the past of aviation in the United States. Before the 1920s, people in the United States first began traveling by airplane.

## Leveraging Big Data Analytics in Aviation Industry - PySpark

Using the big data analytics tool, we performed an analysis on the metadata of the airline flights that occurred in the United States between the years 1987 and 2008. To begin, it is necessary for us to investigate the past of aviation in the United States. Before the 1920s, people in the United States first began traveling by airplane. This was the decade in which air mail transportation in the United States became the most common, and it was during this time period that the airline transported its first load of mail along with passengers on a single flight. 
1.	Which airline has the greatest amount of cancelled flights? Why do these Airlines have the highest amount of cancellations, and what can those causes be?
2.	Which year appears to have had the most flights cancelled overall, and what may the potential causes be? Is it wise to make decisions only based on data?
3.	Which domestic airline routes in the US had the largest flight traffic, and between which two stations?
4.	Which airline is the world's biggest public airline companies by number of passengers carried between 1987 and 2008?
5.	Which airlines are the main rivals of the largest publicly traded airline corporations in the world in terms of passenger volume?
6.	Which year sees the most flight bookings and the aviation industry's boom?
7.	Which month of the year do individuals most frequently travel?
8.	Which day of the month saw the highest number of passengers taking flights?
9.	Which day of the week saw the highest number of passengers taking flights



# Extracting the Data: glob function
We have about 26 CSV files, and we have used the glob faction to combine all of the CSV files that have the same pattern into a single massive file that we have called csv files. df spark data frame contains 118.9 million records and 29 different variables. We have utilized Spark API to perform analysis on the large dataset. 

# Data cleaning
Because our primary focus was on airport traffic and canceled flights, and because our analysis contains 29 columns, we do not make extensive use of the majority of the columns. The amount of time it takes to complete a command will increase if we include those columns in our dataset that are not being used. Therefore, we reduced the number of columns in the data frame from 17 to 12, which was more manageable.

# Conclusion
PySpark is an application programming interface (API) for Python that was developed by the Apache Spark team in order to integrate Python and Spark. PySpark makes it easy to integrate RDDs into Python programs and to manipulate them. In its role as a framework for the management of massive datasets, PySpark performs an important function. PySpark has been an invaluable tool for us as we work with and compute on large datasets.
Python is a tool that can help you maximize the potential of your data skills. Python is an appealing choice due to its many desirable characteristics. This includes making things easier to understand while simultaneously streamlining the syntax and increasing readability. The fact that Python can be used for both object-oriented and functional programming is perhaps its most appealing quality.
